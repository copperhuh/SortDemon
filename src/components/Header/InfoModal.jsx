						<h3>Info</h3>
						<p>
							<span className="bold">SORT DEMON</span> is a
							visualizer of sorting algorithms. It is meant to be
							used as a tool{" "}
							<span className="bold">
								for learning how the algorithms act and how they
								contrast from one another
							</span>
							. I did <span className="bold">not</span> design it
							to accurately show the relative speed of the
							algorithms, since I deemed it would make the faster
							algorithms{" "}
							<span className="bold">less “readable”</span>.
							Please keep that in mind while using{" "}
							<span className="bold">SORT DEMON</span>.
						</p>
						<h4>About Algorithms</h4>
						<p>
							There can be <span className="bold">up to 9</span>{" "}
							algorithms running at the same time. If after adding
							a new algorithm,{" "}
							<span className="bold">only its name appears</span>,
							just click the <span className="bold">RESET</span>{" "}
							or <span className="bold">SHUFFLE</span> button to
							show it entirely. Also, note that{" "}
							<span className="bold">removing</span> an algorithm{" "}
							<span className="bold">
								in the middle of the runtime
							</span>
							can lead to some strange behavior that is also
							easily fixed with a{" "}
							<span className="bold">RESET</span> or{" "}
							<span className="bold">SHUFFLE</span>. Another thing
							- the more structurally{" "}
							<span className="bold">complex algorithms</span>{" "}
							(like the ones using recursion) have to run in their
							entirety <span className="bold">before</span>{" "}
							recreating their steps on the screen. I say that
							because that initial run in the background can lead
							to a slight <span className="bold">lag</span> when
							starting the visualization with a{" "}
							<span className="bold">large array size</span> and{" "}
							<span className="bold">
								multiple of these complex algorithms
							</span>
							.
						</p>
						<h4>About Descriptions</h4>
						<p>
							I do <span className="bold">not</span> take credit
							for <span className="bold">any</span> of the{" "}
							<span className="bold">descriptions’ contents</span>{" "}
							- proper sources are linked at the bottom of each
							description. This is a{" "}
							<span className="bold">personal project</span> - the
							description functionality is just a{" "}
							<span className="bold">feature</span> that I thought
							would be nice to implement and thought that
							authentic articles would look better than some Lorem
							Ipsum boilerplate text. I{" "}
							<span className="bold">strongly recommend </span>
							everyone to visit the websites from which I go the
							articles - all of them are{" "}
							<span className="bold">great resources</span> for
							learning computer science-related topics.
